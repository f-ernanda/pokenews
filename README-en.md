## ðŸ’» About the project

PokÃ©news is born from the idea of bringing news from the PokÃ©mon universe in a collaborative and gentle way! It is an online space where fans can exchange ideas, tips, strategies, and analyses in a welcoming and inclusive community.

The project aims to address the following aspects:

- **News:** Updates with the latest news and announcements related to PokÃ©mon games, potentially extending to other franchise products.
- **Guides:** Useful tutorials to help the community master different aspects of PokÃ©mon games, such as battle strategies, team building, rare PokÃ©mon locations, among others.
- **Game reviews:** Detailed reviews of PokÃ©mon games, including new releases, recommendations of classic games, and comparisons between different titles in the series.
- **Multimedia content:** Suggestions for videos, podcasts, and other multimedia content related to PokÃ©mon, such as gameplays, interviews with development teams, discussions on theories, and curiosities.
